# Databases and Text Editors

## Objectives

1. Write SQL code in your text editor instead of your command line. 
2. Learn how to execute SQL code you've written in your text editor against a database you've created. 

## Notes for whoever writes this:

Explain how to create a `.sql` file that contains SQL code. Explain how to execute that file against a database in the command line. Then, walk through opening up that database and running a query that will confirm that the SQL in the `.sql` file was actually executed. 

Use the text from [this section](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/database-basics#advanced-writing-sql-in-a-text-editor) of the Database Basics read me to inform this reading. Read the [issues on this repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/database-basics) to do so. Then, remove the ["advanced" section] (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/database-basics#advanced-writing-sql-in-a-text-editor) from the Database Basics reading. This reading will directly follow Database Basics.
